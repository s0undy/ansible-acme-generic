# --- ACME Configuration ---
# ACME protocol version (2 = ACMEv2, v1 is deprecated)
acme_version: 2

# Challenge type for domain validation [dns-01]
acme_challenge_type: dns-01

# ACME Account Private Key Configuration
# Options:
#   - RSA: Traditional, maximum compatibility
#   - ECC: Elliptic Curve Cryptography, modern and efficient
acme_account_key_type: ECC

# ACME account RSA key size (only used when acme_account_key_type is RSA)
# Options: 2048 (minimum), 4096 (recommended), 8192 (maximum security)
# acme_account_rsa_key_size: 4096

# ACME account ECC curve (only used when acme_account_key_type is ECC)
# Supported curves: secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1
# secp384r1 offers good balance of security and performance
acme_account_ecc_curve: secp384r1


# --- Environment Selection (Staging vs Production) ---
# STAGING (for testing - use untill you are 100% sure everything works as expected)
acme_directory: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
acme_account_key_path: account/staging-jit-account.key

# PRODUCTION (Has rate limits, test with staging first!)
# acme_directory: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
# acme_account_key_path: account/prod-jit-account.key


# --- CERTIFICATE CONFIGURATION ---
# Primary domain: MUST be the root/base domain (e.g., "example.com")
# This is used as the Common Name (CN) and for certificate directory naming
domain_name: "example.com"

# Subject Alternative Names (SANs): Additional domains to include in certificate
# Include wildcards, subdomains, or related domains here
# Examples:
#   Wildcard + root:     ["*.example.com"]
#   Specific subdomains: ["www.example.com", "api.example.com", "mail.example.com"]
#   Combined:            ["*.example.com", "www.example.com", "api.example.com"]
san_domains: ["*.example.com"]

# Base directory for storing certificates (absolute or relative to playbook)
certs_base_dir: "{{ playbook_dir }}/certs"
# Name of the certificate (used in directory structure)
certs_name: wildcard

# Certificate Private Key Configuration
# Note: Let's Encrypt does NOT support Ed25519, only RSA and ECDSA
# Options:
#   - RSA: Traditional, maximum compatibility with older systems
#   - ECC: ECDSA/Elliptic Curve, modern and efficient (recommended)
private_key_type: ECC

# Certificate RSA key size (only used when private_key_type is RSA)
# Options: 2048 (minimum), 4096 (recommended), 8192 (maximum security)
# cert_rsa_key_size: 4096

# Certificate ECC curve (only used when private_key_type is ECC)
# Supported curves: secp256r1 (P-256), secp384r1 (P-384), secp521r1 (P-521)
# secp384r1 offers good balance of security and performance
cert_ecc_curve: secp384r1

# --- Debug mode ---
# Set to false for normal operation, true for troubleshooting/testing
debug_mode: true
